Fizz Buzz Coding Test 
Fizz Buzz but not as you know it!

Fizz What?
Fizz Buzz is an interesting little test based on a maths game used in some schools to teach division. It has been used for years by programmers who practice TDD coding Kata’s. 
The Fizz Buzz Wikipedia entry states:
“Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word “fizz”, and any number divisible by five with the word “buzz”.”
Developers have taken the game a little further and general replace any word divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word “fizzbuzz”.

Oh, that’s easy!
Yes, creating a one line solution to the problem is fairly easy and the following shows a common example.
 
However this is not testable code and is not representative of clean, maintainable code. It also hurts to read it!

The challenge
The coding challenge we would like you to complete is: 
“To create a solution to the Fizz Buzz problem, using C#, that is built using Reflection and which demonstrates a clean, Test Driven approach using SOLID design principles.”
Again the problem you are looking to solve is:
“Given a range of numbers, loop through each number and output the following:
•	If the number is divisible by 3 then output the word Fizz instead of the number.
•	If the number is divisible by 5 then output the word Buzz instead of the number.
•	If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then output the word Fizzbuzz instead of the number.
•	If none of the above conditions are met then output the number.

For the purpose of this test you should use a range of 1 to 100. Output of the results should be to a console window.”

Your solution should:
•	Be provided in a git repo that can be accessed (GitHub etc) and cloned.
•	Have a commit history that demonstrates the approach to your unit tests. For example, a commit that shows your failing test, another that shows your implementation and so on as you implement more and more of your solution. 
•	Have no failing tests.
•	Show your knowledge of SOLID design patterns and how they can be used within C#.
•	Demonstrate your approach to writing clean, production grade code.
•	Take no more than 1.5 hours from start to finish (trackable from your commit history).

There is no right or wrong solution here. You should be comfortable explaining the solution that you create and explaining your implementation choices.

Have fun!
